# Kickstarter-Prediction

# Overview

This project focuses on predicting the success of Kickstarter campaigns using machine learning models. The classification task identifies whether a project will be successful or failed at launch, while clustering is used to segment projects based on common characteristics.

The best classification model achieved 78% accuracy using Random Forest, and clustering revealed three distinct project types based on launch timing, funding goals, and project categories.
